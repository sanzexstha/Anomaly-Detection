# CSC-790-01-Project

The aim of this project is develop an efficient and robust anomaly detection that will be capable of detect anomalies in complex distribution of data. We will implement a Transformer-based model with sparse attention mechanism that will improve the efficiency of the model without compromising accuracy.
